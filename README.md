# Better Reads App

## Description
The Better Reads app is a simple web application that allows users to search for books by author name. It utilizes the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to fetch book data based on user queries. Better Reads will display book covers along with book details such as title, average rating, and genre. Users can also add and delete books from their library.  Once books are in their library, a user can click on the book cover and be taken to Amazon.com to purchase that particular book.
